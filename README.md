# Danil-Bio-Readme

My name is Danil Harding. I am a rising senior from Horace Mann School. I have experience with Python, Java, C#, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Dart. Using GitHub, I hope to be able to share a couple of projects that I am working on and potentially collaborate with other like-minded coders.
